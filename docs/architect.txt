Architecture:

Backend:
- PROJECT
    - Contains the overall configuration and settings for the PROJECT
- APPS
    - Users: handles user authentication and profiles
    - Dashboard: manages the user dashboard

    - Each app will have __init__.py, models.py, views.py, urls.py, forms.py, templates/
- Other Suggestions
    - Profile model potentially extending user model

ML model
- ALGORITHM
    - Linear regression for race prediction
    - Logistic regression for injury risk
    - Decision trees?: classifying
    - Random forest?: predicting injury risk based on multiple user attributes
    - Support vector?: Classifying types of running terrains based on gps data
    - K-Nearest Neighbors?: Classifying runner performance categories based on past performance data
